It would be greatly appreciated if you would consider donating to HelpfulTechVids at http://www.helpfultechvids.com/about-us/ to show appreciation for writing this code.  Donations are 100% applied to the purchase of new technology in an effort to continue producing educational videos as well as help offset the time to produce the videos.  Without donations and positive, it is difficult to work up the motivation to create new videos.  If this code saved you a few hours of time, it is easily worth at least $5 worth of donation.

To be honest, the only reason this code is being hosted is because we said in the video that we would host it for free.  We're going to provide the code at no cost for a trial run to see how many people legitimately appreciate the work put in to this whole process.  

Simply put, future code packages may not be provided if the appreciation is not there.
